# TODOs

- The config page: 
  - Rebuild PlainTextEditable from scratch
  - Ability to copy the whole list and ability to paste multiple elements
  - Configurable timing for sets / rest
- The timer page:
  - Explicit countdown to start rather than the 1-sec countdown that exists more
  or less by accident.
  - Style timer UI similarly to the config
  - A back button (to return to config) and a play/pause button
  - Activities should be highlighted as they happen in a vertical carousel. For
  inspiration:
